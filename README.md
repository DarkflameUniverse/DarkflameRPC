# Darkflame Rich Presence Client

This is built using the [Discord RPC C# project](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) and contains minimal code written by the Darkflame team in the DarkflameRPC folder.

Build the DarkflameRPC.sln and run the generated DarkflameRPC.exe once you've opened your LEGO Universe game client. This doesn't start automatically with the LU client and must manually be run each time.

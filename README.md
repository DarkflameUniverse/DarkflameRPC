# Darkflame Rich Presence Client

This is built using the [Discord RPC C# project](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) and contains minimal code written by the Darkflame team in the DarkflameRPC folder.

Build the DarkflameRPC.sln and run the generated DarkflameRPC.exe once you've opened your LEGO Universe game client. This doesn't start automatically with the LU client and must manually be run each time.

This project features images from various contributors of [the LEGO Universe Wiki](https://legouniverse.fandom.com/wiki/LEGO_Universe_Wiki) and various promotional images of the game. This application solely allows you to display current world and time elapsed playing LEGO Universe as your Discord Rich Presence.

# System Requirements

This has only been tested and confirmed to work on Windows 10, using the windows path to the client log files. This will not work on other operating systems without changes.
